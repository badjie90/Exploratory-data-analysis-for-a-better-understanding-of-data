#### Building Machine Learning Pipelines

Within this repository, there are three distinct folders, each of which contributes to an in-depth comprehension of exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and feature selection in machine learning. Specifically, this particular folder, which contains Python codes, serves as an invaluable resource for learners looking to delve into the complexities of visualizing, analyzing, and comprehending the features of a specific dataset. By utilizing the codes included in this repository, learners can develop the skills and knowledge necessary to make informed decisions when it comes to working with data and ultimately become proficient in the field of machine learning.



The core emphasis lies in the development of Machine Learning Pipelines that encompass the entire life cycle of a Data Science project. This approach assumes great significance for practitioners who lack experience in handling voluminous datasets. By adopting a comprehensive perspective, individuals can glean insights into the various stages involved in a Data Science project. 


The holistic approach towards Machine Learning Pipelines can further enable professionals to create robust and reliable models, which are capable of delivering accurate predictions and insights. Furthermore, the comprehensive nature of this approach can also help to address the various challenges and issues that may arise during the different stages of a Data Science project. As such, it offers a holistic solution that ensures that all the intricacies and nuances of the project are taken into account.
